# README: Python Function Practice and Elm City Pizza Ordering System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a variety of Python programming techniques to solve real-world problems. It includes practical exercises on functions, data manipulation, and iterative processing, culminating in the development of an interactive pizza ordering system for a fictional vegan restaurant, **Elm City Pizza**. The project covers:

1. Function creation and usage.
2. Data categorization and processing using loops, comprehensions, and dictionaries.
3. Real-world scenarios, including diplomacy, trade, and economic analysis.
4. An interactive application for order management with input validation and logic handling.

### Section 2: Elm City Pizza Ordering System

**Description:**  
An interactive, user-friendly program designed to handle pizza orders for Elm City Pizza, a fictional vegan restaurant. The application integrates multiple functionalities to simulate a complete online ordering experience.

**Features:**

1. **Phone Number Validation:**  
   Ensures that users enter the correct phone number (203-555-5555) to proceed.

2. **Personalized Greetings:**  
   Collects the user’s name and provides a friendly, personalized ordering experience.

3. **Dynamic Menu Display:**  
   Includes pizzas, salads, and customizable toppings:
   - Pizzas: **Small ($6.95), Medium ($8.95), Large ($10.90)**
   - Toppings: **Shitake, Jackfruit, Sweet Potato, and more (each $0.50).**
   - Salads: **Vegan Caesar, Vegan Greek, Cucumber_Tumeric_Tomato** (Small: $4.95, Large: $6.95).

4. **Strict Vegan Policy:**  
   If users request non-vegan items like meat or cheese, they are politely informed and the ordering session is terminated.

5. **Order Summary and Cost Calculation:**  
   The application displays a detailed breakdown of the user’s order, including individual item prices and the total cost.

6. **Re-Ordering Logic:**  
   Prevents users from placing another order too quickly using the same name, encouraging them to "evolve" before trying again.
